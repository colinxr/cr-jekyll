I"<p>Hey dudes! Hope youâ€™re good.</p>

<p>Welcome to the new <a href="http://colinrabyniuk.com">http://colinrabyniuk.com</a>. Itâ€™s pretty simple, but take a look around anyway. Itâ€™s powered by Jekyll and based off this cool theme <a href="http://mattcouchman.github.com/jekyll-resume">here</a> so, yeah. Iâ€™m listening to Guns â€™n Roses right now, as well. So thatâ€™s a thing.</p>

<h4 id="whos-jekyll">Whoâ€™s Jekyll?</h4>

<p>Not who, but what! Jekyll is a pretty cool little static site generator. Think of it like wordpress but with way less overheaad. Iâ€™ve been meaning to play around with it for a while. But, you know, havenâ€™t.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s nice to have the benefits of a CMS without the overhead of a wordpress install. Iâ€™m going to be using this space to share whatâ€™s been going on with me â€“ things Iâ€™m learning, stuff Iâ€™m working on. So, yeah, hope you enjoy.</p>
