    languages: Javascript, React.js
    time: January 2018
    description: React Weathr is my first go around at using React.js. It's a simple way to get the forecast using the Reach and OpenWeatherMap API. React took a minute to wrap my head around, but once I got it I really enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to working with it more.

    languages: HTML5, SCSS, Javascript
    time: April 2016 - Present
    description: At Sharp, I've put together a variety of <a href="http://sharpmagazine.com/features/grace-too/" target="_blank">editorial</a> <a href="http://sharpmagazine.com/features/henry-cavill/" target="_blank">features</a> for the <a href="http://sharpmagazine.com/features/taming-the-beast/" target="_blank">magazine</a>. They're fun projects that let me design and develop. In the magazine, these articles would be big multi-page spreads, cover stories, but they often lose their impact when just put into a standard CMS template. These executions incease the impact of the stories online.
