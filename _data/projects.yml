    description: Most Canadian news services are not making strong digital products. NoFeed is an exploration of what a digital-first, tech-driven, Canadian-based news aggregator could look like. Using Node.js, the app parses a growing list of newsources, using NLP to categorize and group stories into a reverse chron newsfeed, where a human editor can curate and publish the best and most relevant stories.

-   title: Sharp Magazine â€“ Custom Features
    languages: HTML5, SCSS, Vue.js
    time: April 2016 - Present
    description: At Sharp, I've put together a variety of editorial features for the <a href="sharpmagazine.com/" target="_blank">magazine</a>. They're fun projects that let me design and develop. In the magazine, these articles would be big multi-page spreads, cover stories, but they often lose their impact when just put into a standard CMS template. These executions incease the impact of the stories online.
