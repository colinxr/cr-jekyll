Hey dudes! Hope you&rsquo;re good.

Welcome to the new <http://colinrabyniuk.com>. It&rsquo;s pretty simple, but take a look around anyway. It&rsquo;s powered by Jekyll and based off this cool theme [here](http://mattcouchman.github.com/jekyll-resume) so, yeah. I&rsquo;m listening to Guns &rsquo;n Roses right now, as well. So that's a thing.

#### Who's Jekyll?

Not who, but what! Jekyll is a pretty cool little static site generator. Think of it like wordpress but with way less overheaad. I've been meaning to play around with it for a while. But, you know, haven&rsquo;t.

It&rsquo;s nice to have the benefits of a CMS without the overhead of a wordpress install. I'm going to be using this space to share what's been going on with me â€“ things I&rsquo;m learning, stuff I&rsquo;m working on. So, yeah, hope you enjoy.
