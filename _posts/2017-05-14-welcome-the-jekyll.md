Hey dudes! Hope you're good.

Welcome to the new <http://colinrabyniuk.com>. It's pretty simple, but take a look around anyway. It's powered by Jekyll and based off this cool theme [here](http://mattcouchman.github.com/jekyll-resume) so, yeah. I'm listening to Guns 'n Roses right now, as well. So that's a thing.

#### Who's Jekyll?

Not who, but what! Jekyll is a pretty cool little static site generator. I've been meaning to play around with it for a while. But, you know, haven't.

#### Highlighted Code Blocks

To modify styling and highlight colors edit `/_sass/_highlighter.scss`.
